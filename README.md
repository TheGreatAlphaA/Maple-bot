# Maple-bot
A discord bot containing a collection of smaller projects designed to make my life easier.

Features:

- Tracks the top Hypixel Skyblock users for Ghast Tear collection and logs their daily collection gains.
- Estimates the daily profit/loss for a collection of 30 T12 Ghast Tear Minions on Hypixel Skyblock
- Calculates the estimated time until a T12 Ghast Minion has been filled, pings user once it is 90% filled.
- Rolls dice used for TTRPGs, such as d20s, d10s, d100s, etc.
- Rolls dice for creatures summoned in DND, such as with the spell Conjure Animals.
- Tracks keywords in the daily deals channel, pings users if a keyword is mentioned.
- Tracks the bot's current public ip address, logs any changes.
- And many other micro projects!

Upcoming features:
- Calculate the estimated time any minion has been filled
- Add dice rolling for non-summoning spells (ex: fireball)
- Deciphering tool for Binary, Hexadecimal, ROT13, etc.
- Docker status indicator. Warn when dockers are listed as offline
- Remote control of docker containers (not sure if this is safe tbh)
- Reminders for any arbitrary time
- Reminders for special events
- Database image viewer for irl collections
- Local weather tracking
- LLM + 11ai support? Give maple a voice?
